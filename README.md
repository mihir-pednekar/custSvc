# custSvc

We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. 
We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. 
Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers 
(within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).

Steps to install:-

  # After extracting the project to your workspace on your IDE, open CustomerConstants.java file to change the path of input file of variable
  eg. INPUT_FILE_PATH = C:\\Users\\mihir\\git\\custSvc\\custSvc\\src\\main\\java\\customerSvc\\input\\customers.txt to your directory location
  of the customer.txt file also change path of variable
  eg. OUTPUT_FILE_PATH = C:\\Users\\mihir\\git\\custSvc\\custSvc\\src\\main\\java\\customerSvc\\output\\output.txt to your preferred
  output location.
  
  After that run App.java having main method for execution.
